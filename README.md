## Description:

#### Do you often have games recomeneded to you only to forget about them when you are looking for a new game to play? Do you have a library of games so vast that you forget you even have certain games? Do you get stuck in games and say, "I'll come back to this one later. I need a break.", and then never touch the game again?

#### If you answered yes to any of these, then Backlog is the app for you! Backlog lets you add games to your backlog so its easier to remember exactly what you have to play. Just search for the game and add it. It is as simple as that.

## Technologies Used:

- React
- CSS
- JavaScript
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Express
- APIs

## Getting Started:

#### Go to the search page to start searching for and adding games to your library.

#### When you start a game, click on the "In Progress" option so you can see what games you have started. Want to start a new game? No problem. Add some notes to the game you are taking a break from so its easier to know exactly where you left off when you decide to start again.

#### When you finish a game, click on the finished option. You can now either keep the game in your backlog as complete and marvel at how many games you have completed, or delete the game from your backlog.
