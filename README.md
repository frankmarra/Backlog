## Description:

#### Warren Zevon once said, "We love to buy books because we think we are buying the time to read them". The same could be said about anything, especially video games. With games growing in size exponentially over the years, with some being hundreds of hours long, it has become a daunting task to finish every game you purchase. That doesn't stop us from buying more games before we finish the ones we have, though.

#### This is the reason why Backlog was created. Backlog aims to help you keep track of your library of games by sorting them into catagories of 'Not Started', 'In Progress', and 'Completed'. You are also able to add notes to the games in your library, so if you decide to take a break from one game and start another. This will make it easier to come back to a game later on and have useful information to look at.

#### We know that it is impossible to ever truly complete your backlog, but at least this will help you be a little more organized. Game on!

#### From there, you will be taken to your Backlog, where you can start searching for games to add. When you find the game you are looking for, click on the card to go to the game details page. You can now click on the button to add this game to your Backlog. Games added will default to the 'Not Started' status, but you can update this by clicking on the drop down next to 'Level Up'.

#### You can now go back to your Backlog and see that this game is either on your 'Not Started' shelf, or whatever status you set the game to. You can continue to add games to build your Backlog.

#### Clicking on a game card on one of your shelves will bring you back to the game detail screen. You can update the status of the game, or add notes in the text area, just make sure you save what you do.

#### When you finish a game, click on the finished option. You can now either keep the game in your backlog as complete and marvel at how many games you have completed, or delete the game from your backlog.
